This is a task manager app. you can login-sign up and Login is available as Administrator. ÙŽAdmin can see all users and their tasks and password.(All information of users and tasks save on the database. )
After login you could see the main page. By using floating action button, you could add your task and choose todo, doing and done state for your task also you can choose date and time for your task then you have to press on save to save task on the database. After that apear a cardview related to task on the main page. By click on it you could edit the task and also add photo for it or delete it. Also you could share the task. (In this project I've used implicit intent for take photo and share the task)

In summary, in this app I've used GreenDao as data base. I've used singletone in repository, Factory, builder, DAO and repository design patterns also I've used recycler view, view pagr, tablayout, material design, float action button and dialog in this app.
